# Mathematische Modellierung in der Klimaforschung
This repository contains the course material I created as a voluntary lecturer for the tutorial *Mathematical Modelling in Climate Research* at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. The `.tex` files used to generate the lecture notes are available upon request.

The material from week ten onwards was adapted from [Paul Connolly's webpage](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/paul.connolly/teaching/practicals/shallow_water_equations.html) on the Shallow Water Equations.

The two textbooks I used extensively in preparing these material were Randall J. LeVeque's
