# Mathematische Modellierung in der Klimaforschung
This repository contains the course material I created as a voluntary lecturer for the tutorial *Mathematical Modelling in Climate Research* at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. The `.tex` files used to generate the lecture notes are available upon request.
