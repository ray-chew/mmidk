    "When we worked on our oscillator problem, we only had one first-order derivative w.r.t $t$ and in this case, we needed only an *initial condition*. Now as we are dealing with spatial derivatives, we also need a set of *boundary conditions* and a *spatial grid*.\n",

Can you discretise the right-hand side of (2) with this method?\n",
