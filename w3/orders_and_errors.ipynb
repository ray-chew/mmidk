    "## The order of a numerical method\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we came across the explicit Euler, and the Euler-A and Euler-B methods. These are first-order methods, while the Störmer-Verlet is a second-order method. The \"order\" here refers to [order of accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_accuracy) of the numerical method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that for the Euler-A and Euler-B methods, a step size of $\\Delta t=0.1$ is unable to reproduce the theoretical phase space diagram. The example phase space plot for the Euler-A method is provided below:\n",

    "On the other hand, if we were decrease the time step-size to $\\Delta t=0.01$, i.e. to run our problem at a higher resolution, our numerical solution is able to better reproduce the theoretical phase space diagram:\n",
