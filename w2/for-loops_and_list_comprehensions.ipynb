    "# Definition: for-loops\n",
    "The for-loop is a simple concept. Over a range of numbers or items, a for-loop will go through each number or item sequentially and terminates when it reaches the end of the range. In python, the for-loop is initialised with a `for <item> in <range>:`. The code snippet below provides a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Unlike in many other programming languages, we want to avoid using for-loops in Python as they may be excruciatingly slow here. In future exercises, we will encounter more concrete scenarios where using a for-loop may be the easiest solution, and we will learn how to efficiently *vectorise* our code to avoid using unnecessary for-loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations such as numerical intergration over time or over dimensions, a for-loop may be unavoidable. For unavoidable for-loops that are in critical parts of the code, you may want to use a *just-in-time compiler* such as [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/). "
